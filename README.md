## project
This is directory contains my final project from APCS, Pacman.

Depending on your environment setup, you may need to run the program a different way, but generally this should work:

```
$ cd project
$ ./processing main.pde

proceed to use the processing interface to run
```

NOTE: You will need the processing program, which can be found [here](https://processing.org/download/).

A trimmed down version of the README is also in this directory. To view the original project, go [here](https://github.com/kkhan01/APCS2_Final_Project).
## cpp

Sample program in C++ is provided here. It includes input checks, and fibonacci and factorial algorithms.

```
$ g++ sample.cpp -o sample
$ ./sample
```

Follow on screen instructions to use it.

NOTE: It is preferred to use g++, although gcc should be compatible as well. Windows users should use codeblocks because gitbash doesn't play nicely with i/o streams.
